This builds upon @Taha-Hassan-Git 's great work and knowledge in this area, thanks man. :tip-o-the-hat:  Things that were tackled in this PR: - navigating shapes using the Tab key, when in the Select tool. - navigating shapes using Cmd/Ctrl+Arrow keys, when in the Select tool. - only allowing certain shapes to be navigated to. We ignore draw/highlighter/arrow/group/line. Groups need exploration and will be tackled later. - panning the camera to the selected shape, but avoiding doing so in a jarring way. We don't center the shape to avoid too much whiplashy-ness.  An initial foray into this was relaying purely on DOM but it had a bunch of browser quirks which forced making this purely a programmatic control on our end. Things like ensuring culled shapes are still accessible even though they're not rendered was one of the issues but also tab order became unpredictable at times which steered me away from that direction.  We coud have considered using something like rbush for some spatial indexing of the shapes. For the intents and purposes of this PR, it seemed like overkill at the moment. But we might cross that bridge down the line, we'll see.  The reading-direction heuristics are a combination of dividing the pages into rows and then looking at distance and angles to see what is the spatially \"next\" shape to be read. It takes _all_ of the shapes and sorts them into a logical order so that nothing is missed/skipped when tabbing around. The directional-arrow heuristics don't divide things into rows and don't create a sorted set of shapes. Instead, they decide based on the current shape and direction which is the next spatially to go to, depending on distance+angle.

This builds upon @Taha-Hassan-Git 's great work and knowledge in this area, thanks man. :tip-o-the-hat:  Things that were tackled in this PR: - navigating shapes using the Tab key, when in the Select tool. - navigating shapes using Cmd/Ctrl+Arrow keys, when in the Select tool. - only allowing certain shapes to be navigated to. We ignore draw/highlighter/arrow/group/line. Groups need exploration and will be tackled later. - panning the camera to the selected shape, but avoiding doing so in a jarring way. We don't center the shape to avoid too much whiplashy-ness.  An initial foray into this was relaying purely on DOM but it had a bunch of browser quirks which forced making this purely a programmatic control on our end. Things like ensuring culled shapes are still accessible even though they're not rendered was one of the issues but also tab order became unpredictable at times which steered me away from that direction.  We coud have considered using something like rbush for some spatial indexing of the shapes. For the intents and purposes of this PR, it seemed like overkill at the moment. But we might cross that bridge down the line, we'll see.  The reading-direction heuristics are a combination of dividing the pages into rows and then looking at distance and angles to see what is the spatially \"next\" shape to be read. It takes _all_ of the shapes and sorts them into a logical order so that nothing is missed/skipped when tabbing around. The directional-arrow heuristics don't divide things into rows and don't create a sorted set of shapes. Instead, they decide based on the current shape and direction which is the next spatially to go to, depending on distance+angle.
